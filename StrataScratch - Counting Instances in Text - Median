Find the number of times the words 'bull' and 'bear' occur in the contents. We're counting the number of times the words occur so words like 'bullish' should not be included in our count.
Output the word 'bull' and 'bear' along with the corresponding number of occurrences.
Table: google_file_store

Solution-
from pyspark.sql.functions import *

df = google_file_store.select("contents")\
        .withColumn("contents", explode(split(col("contents"), ' ')) )\
        .filter(lower(col("contents")).rlike("bull|bear"))\
        .groupBy("contents").agg(count("contents").alias("nentry"))

df.toPandas()
