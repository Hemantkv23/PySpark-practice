Write a query that'll identify returning active users. A returning active user is a user that has made a second purchase within 7 days of any other of their purchases. Output a list of user_ids of these returning active users.
Table: amazon_transactions

Solution-
from pyspark.sql.functions import *
from pyspark.sql.window import Window

df = amazon_transactions.select("user_id", "created_at") 
window = Window.partitionBy("user_id").orderBy("created_at")

df = df.withColumn("next_purchase_date", lead("created_at").over(window))\
        .dropna(subset=["next_purchase_date"])\
        .filter(
            (datediff(col("next_purchase_date"), col("created_at"))<=7)
            )\
        .select("user_id").distinct()    

df.toPandas()
